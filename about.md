# 👋 Introduction

Hi! I’m **Benson**, a final-year Computer Science student at **NUS**.  
I built this little corner of the web to document my tech journey, share what I’m learning, and connect with people who share similar passions.

# 🚀 Getting into Computer Science

After completing my national service, I took a part-time tutoring job at a tuition centre. There I discovered the admin staff were creating invoices one-by-one using an online generator — typing fields like student name, lesson count, dates, and total amount for over a hundred students.

I thought, *there has to be a better way.*

So I wrote a **Google Script** that pulled data from a table and filled a PDF invoice template for each student. What used to take nearly a day was reduced to **five minutes**. That small automation showed me how tech can simplify real work — and that’s what pushed me into Computer Science.

# 💻 What I Do

I’m passionate about building **intelligent systems** and **scalable web applications**. I enjoy working at the intersection of:
- **AI & Machine Learning** — turning data into useful insights
- **Web Apps** — crafting tools people actually use

# 🌱 Life Outside Coding

When I’m not building stuff, I’m usually:
- 📚 Geeking out over *One Piece* (the “Fan Letter” episode hits different)
- 🎸 Practising guitar — fingerstyle and chord playing (still improving!)
- 🏃 Going for runs to clear my head
- 🏀 Playing basketball to keep fit!
- 🎮 Playing Dota 2 — proud to have reached **Immortal** rank 😎

# Recycling is Fun!  

## My First Hackathon Experience  
Before I even entered NUS, my friends and I jumped into **NUS LifeHack 2022**, where the theme was *Environment*. With only **48 hours** on the clock and not much coding experience under our belts, we knew building a polished web app or complex system was out of reach. Instead, we asked ourselves: *what could we make that‚Äôs simple, fun, and impactful?*  

That‚Äôs how we landed on the idea of a **game about recycling**.  

## Our Hack  
We built a game where players match different items to their correct recycling bins ‚Äî paper, metal, glass, and plastic ‚Äî while the difficulty ramps up as the game goes on. We even threw in ‚Äútrick items‚Äù that aren‚Äôt recyclable, just to keep things interesting.  

Our goal was simple: to **teach kids about recycling in a fun and interactive way**. By turning recycling education into a playful challenge, we wanted to spark curiosity early on and show that caring for the environment doesn‚Äôt have to feel like a chore ‚Äî it can actually be part of the game.

## How We Made It  
We built our project with **Python and PyGame**, following a YouTube tutorial to learn the basics of object bounding boxes and how to manipulate them. PyGame was the backbone of our hack, giving us the tools to display and control images in a simple GUI.  

To keep players engaged, we added a **progressive difficulty system**: as the game went on, items would fall faster and appear more frequently. This ramped up the challenge and kept the gameplay fun and exciting.  

## Challenges  
Debugging was easily the toughest part. Sometimes objects simply refused to drag, or the score wouldn‚Äôt update correctly. We often found ourselves staring at the screen, combing through code line by line to figure out what was going wrong. It was frustrating, but it sharpened my **code tracing and debugging skills** more than anything else I‚Äôd done before.  

## Results  
We honestly weren‚Äôt sure how our project would stack up against others ‚Äî some teams had flashy apps and complex solutions. To our surprise, we ended up winning the **Most Outstanding Freshmen Hack** award! üéâ  

It was a huge milestone for us, especially considering we had barely started learning how to code at the time. That recognition gave us the confidence that with creativity and teamwork, we could build things that mattered.
